# $ whoami

I am an Engineer at SmartThings, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

I try to be an active member of the local development community as well as an open source contributor. I am very interested in creating code that is easy to maintain and share not only within a team but in the broader community as well.

I run the local [Cassandra user group](http://www.meetup.com/Minneapolis-St-Paul-Cassandra-Meetup/) and help with the [Groovy Users of Minnesota](http://www.meetup.com/groovymn/).

I am a [Ratpack](http://ratpack.io) core team member.
