# $ whoami

I am a Tech Lead at ReachLocal, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have been doing Grails since 2010.

I try to be an active member of the local Groovy community as well as an open source contributor, contributing to Grails plugins and [Ratpack](http://ratpack.io) in my free time. I am very interested in creating code that is easy to maintain and share not only within a team but in the broader community as well.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@beckje01](https://twitter.com/beckje01)
