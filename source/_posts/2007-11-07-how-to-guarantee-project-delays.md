Some of my recent experiences in a project that never seems to end. With this project I was acting as a programmer and the client was contracting our services to finish an already started project that was never completed. The release date has slipped but not by much so far.



#### Jump in head first with your clothes on

The first mistake on my side of things was not really thinking more about why the last programmer didn’t finish the project. I just thought hey probably just wasn’t good enough to do the work (Yep that would be the standard Software Engineer’s mentality were only I know how to solve a problem.) what caused the last project to not get finished I have since come to get an idea of what it might of been but had I asked more about this upfront I might have avoided further problems. Another fault that happened up front was to not to think what it meant to pick up a project that had been going for 3 years and saying that the there was nothing usable and everything needed to be redone from scratch. It was true it really did need to be done over completely it needed AJAX to really be at all easy to use. As it was everything was hard coded every drop down everything thus any minor changes which should be easy become very hard. But just because one person in the company understands you’re starting over doesn’t mean everyone else will.

#### Annoy the developers

The best way to slow down developers is to simply annoy them. Don’t ask for a developer who works from home to come sit on-site so you can watch them. First of all I work from home for a reason, I want to work at odd hours. I don’t want to come sit in a closet that has become your server room and work. I have my two LCDs for a reason I don’t want to work on a small CRT. That annoyance sets the mood how hard do I want to push myself on this project when the first thing I think of is this whole issue. Ok it may seem stupid to some but I enjoy coding at my computer in my setting with my **window** I don’t enjoy it nearly as much with out everything how I like it. Also who wants someone watching them code? Thats exactly what our client wanted to do, kinda maks me feel like you want free lessons.

#### Feature creep

Want dead lines to just fly by with barely a blink well no problem just keep slightly adding small “refinements” or “corrections” until suddenly there is a whole new set of really nice shiny features and half of the core features are broken or haven’t even been started. Its easy to let happen so, document document document at the start. If you set up very clean and clear documents on what exactly should be produced both sides will be happier in the end even though it will delay the start a bit its worth the delay in the end.

#### Duplicate work

If you are writing out how something should work don’t just send it off when its done, have someone else proof it for you first. Just because it may make sense to you it may not to everyone. Due to some confusion the formula for one part of this project was implemented incorrectly which means I had to go back through and redo the work completely which will always take longer than the first time through when your changing how it works, not because its harder but because you’ve already went through this once and your sick of looking at this section of code.

#### Delayed Testing

So as developers fix bugs and mark them as resolved, have your quality team (person) check the newly resolved things quickly. If it takes a week before the bug is checked the developer will have lost any advantage of just working with that code to fix further issues. Besides the fact that if one area keeps popping up causing problems it starts to haunt the developer as even when they think its gone it will pop back up out of no where.
