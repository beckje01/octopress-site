If you are creating a web app for the iPhone there is an easy to to hide the address bar when opening the page from a link on the users home screen. You simply need to add the following meta tag to your  
head. This will also work with the iPad.

``` xml
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
```
