When working with jQuery 1.6.1 and the [jQuery Form Example Plugin][1] I found that the examples were being serialized the plan was to use Ajax to send the serialized data back to the server and save it but I didnâ€™t want to have to try and remove the examples server side. So triggering unload on the examples will allow serialize to get the correct data. Example JavaScript below.
``` js
    var examples = $('.example');
    _.each(examples,function(elm){
        $(elm).unload();
    });
```

I used [Userscore.js][2] to give me a quick foreach style loop and called the unload event on every element that has the class .example which is the default class that jQuery Form Example plugin uses.
