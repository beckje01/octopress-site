One feature I have really liked on my blogs recently is the ability to just use Twitter to comment so I went ahead and added the DISQUS Comment system the plugin is straight forward and easy to use with WordPress. Moving forward with new site projects I will be strongly considering using [DISQUS ][1]instead of an internal comment system, I would suggest checking it out as well as [InenseDebate ][2].
