Using the JMS 1.2 plugin with Grails 2.3.0.RC1 was producing a number of odd results. Mostly with missing JMS files it turns out that the new spring version didnâ€™t have the needed spring jms included. Just add the following to BuildConfig.groovy

``` groovy
    dependencies {
      compile 'org.springframework:spring-jms:3.2.4.RELEASE'
      ...
    }
```
