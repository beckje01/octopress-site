While working with Grails and the Spring Security plugin, the current spring security filter chain is available in the *springSecurityFilterChain* bean. It is very easy with that to show what the current chain looks like so you can work through filter chain issues. I used the following code in the [Grails Console][1] plugin to get the bean:


``` groovy
def filterChain = ctx.getBean('springSecurityFilterChain')
```
Also if you want to poke around the other beans available this is a great post to check out: [Spring Beans from the Grails Console][2] .
