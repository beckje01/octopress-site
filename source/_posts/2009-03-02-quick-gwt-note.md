While working on a small GWT project with two other developers I ran into an odd runtime exception “com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.IncompatibleRemoteServiceException” as I was testing my app in the hosted mode I’m not sure how to refresh that built in browser which is the listed fix. What I ended up doing was a simple clean of the project which solved my problem, I think it relates to how I’m using SVN not integrated into Eclipse with the project yet its hard to tell. But if you run accross this expection try a simple clean before pulling too much hair out.
